## ðŸ’« Overview 
This repository demonstrates the implementation of common database relationships in MongoDB:

## ðŸª„ Features 
1. One-to-Few: A single document has a limited number of related documents.
2. One-to-Many: A single document has multiple related documents.
3. Many-to-One: Multiple documents are related to a single document.

## ðŸ—‚ Repository Structure
The repository is organized into three main branches, each representing a different relationship:

- one-to-few: Demonstrates a one-to-few relationship using MongoDB's embedded documents.
- one-to-many: Shows a one-to-many relationship using MongoDB's referencing.
- many-to-one: Illustrates a many-to-one relationship using MongoDB's referencing.

## ðŸŽ¬ Getting Started
To explore the relationships, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository using git clone.
2. Install the required dependencies using `npm install`.
3. Start the MongoDB server and connect to it using the `mongo` shell.
4. Explore the relationships by switching between the branches and examining the code and data.

## ðŸ“¥ Contributions
Contributions are welcome! If you'd like to add more relationships or improve the existing examples, please fork the repository and submit a pull request.

## ðŸ“„ Acknowledgments
Thanks to the MongoDB community for providing excellent resources and documentation.
